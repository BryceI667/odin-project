# Odin Project: DOM Demos

This is part of the **Odin Project**.

*This is a set of exercises to teach DOM manipulation using JavaScript.*

## Contents

- [Demo 1](./demo1/) - Basic DOM manipulation testing document.
- [Demo 2](./demo2/) - More practice with DOM manipulation.
- [Demo 3](./demo3/) - A simple grocery list webpage.

## Reflection

These exercises taught me how to manipulate the **DOM** using **JavaScript**. The DOM, short for *Document Object Model*, is a tree of nodes used to represent the structure of a webpage; the order and relationship between nodes is dependent upon how they are arranged in the HTML document. With JavaScript, we gain the ability to be able to dynamically add, modify, and remove HTML elements.
