# Odin Project: Rock Paper Scissors

This is part of the **Odin Project**.

*This showcases a basic rock paper scissors game using **JavaScript**.*

## Skills Learned

- Variables and Operators
- Data Types
- Conditionals (if/else; switch)
- Basic Console Techniques

This project was a good introduction to the language of JavaScript. Although there is not any html or css used on the page, implementing some simple scripts is fundamental to teaching problem solving an debugging skills.

I hope that I can learn more about how to combine html, css, and JavaScript to create a simple frontend project that looks a bit more interesting than this current version.
