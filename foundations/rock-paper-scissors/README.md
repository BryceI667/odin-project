# Odin Project: Rock Paper Scissors

This is part of the **Odin Project**.

*This showcases a basic rock paper scissors game using **JavaScript**.*

## Skills Learned

- DOM manipulation
- Event listeners
- Variables and Operators
- Data Types
- Conditionals (if/else; switch)
- Basic Console Techniques

## Reflection 2 (11/06/2024)

Though the logic behind a rock paper scissors game is extremely simple, learning how to create a basic interface proved to be a valuable challenge and learning experience. After building on this project, I have a better idea on control structure and flow of a nonstatic webpage. Additionally, I learned how to edit the DOM with JavaScript and some CSS to create basic button animations. I will try my best to work faster so that there is not such a long gap between reflections. 

## Reflection 1 (10/11/2024)

This project was a good introduction to the language of JavaScript. Although there is not any html or css used on the page, implementing some simple scripts is fundamental to teaching problem solving an debugging skills.

I hope that I can learn more about how to combine html, css, and JavaScript to create a simple frontend project that looks a bit more interesting than this current version.
