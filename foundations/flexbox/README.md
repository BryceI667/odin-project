# Odin Project: Flexbox
This is part of the **Odin Project**.

*This is a set of exercises to teach Flexbox.*

# Reflection 

These exercises taught me how to use **Flexbox**, a web layout model used to arrange elements efficiently on a webpage. Some of the most fundamental concepts I learned and practiced were **axes**, **growing/shrinking** elements, and **alignment** along axes.
