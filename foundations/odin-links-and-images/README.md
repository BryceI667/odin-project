# Odin Project: Links & Images

This is part of the **Odin Project**.

*This is a set of exercises to teach HTML links and images.*

# Reflection 

This set of practice problems taught me how to link pages in a website with the anchor element `<a>` using the attributes `href` and `rel`. I also learned how to link pages to external websites safely with `rel = noopener noreferrer`. I applied these skills to learn about how to create images in a webpage using the `<img>` element and how to set display text in the event that the image fails to load in.
