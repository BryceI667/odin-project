# Odin Project: Landing Page

This is part of the **Odin Project**.

*This showcases a basic landing page layout using **HTML, CSS,** and **Flexbox**.*

## Skills Learned

- HTML structure and semantic tags
- CSS styling and layout techniques
- Flexbox for responsive design
- Basic DOM manipulation
- Responsive design principles

During this project, I faced challenges with Flexbox, especially aligning elements and ensuring responsiveness across different screen sizes. Understanding how `justify-content` and `align-items` work together took some trial and error. Additionally, integrating DOM manipulation required extra focus on selecting and updating elements dynamically.

These challenges were valuable because they taught me to learn how to ask questions to others online. Working through these difficulties gave me a better understanding of responsive design, a fundamental property for creating user-friendly websites. Since this is just the beginning, I may have overused the  `<div>` and my naming principles are a bit shabby. I will get better eventually with more practice.
